    ["25", "The culture is heavily influenced by another, neighbouring world. Roll again for a cultural quirk that has been inherited from the culture."],
    ["26", "The culture is a merger of two distinct cultures. Roll again twice to determine the quirks inherited from these cultures. If the quirks are incompatible, then the culture is likely divided."],
    ["31", "Physical strength and combat prowess are highly valued in the culture. Travellers may be challenged to a fight, or dismissed if they seem incapable of defending themselves. Sports tend towards the bloody and violent."],
    ["32", "The culture is a surviving remnant of a once-great and vibrant civilisation, clinging to its former glory. The world is filled with crumbling ruins, and every story revolves around the good old days."],
    ["33", "The culture is falling apart and is on the brink of war or economic collapse. Violent protests are common, and the social order is decaying."],
    ["34", "The culture is expanding and vibrant. Fortunes are being made in trade; science is forging bravely ahead."],

    ["43", "Physical conflict is almost unheardof. The culture produces few soldiers, and diplomacy reigns supreme. Forceful Travellers will be ostracised."],
    ["44", "Everyone is obsessed with or addicted to a substance, personality, act or item. This monomania pervades every aspect of the culture."],

    ["51", "Space travellers hold a unique position in the culture’s mythology or beliefs, and travellers will be expected to live up to these myths."],
    ["52", "The planet’s starport is more than a commercial centre; it might be a religious temple, or be seen as highly controversial and surrounded by protestors."],

    ["56", "The culture has a distinct caste system. Travellers of a low social standing who do not behave appropriately will face punishment."],
    ["61", "The culture has an odd attitude towards some aspect of commerce, which may interfere with trade at the spaceport. For example, merchants might expect a gift as part of a deal, or some goods may only be handled by certain families."],
    ["62", "Those of high social standing have a strange custom associated with them; perhaps nobles are blinded, or must live in gilded cages, or only serve for a single year before being exiled."],
    ["63", "The culture has an unusual attitude towards intercourse and reproduction. Perhaps cloning is used instead, or sex is used to seal commercial deals."],
    ["64", "Food and drink occupies an unusual place in the culture. Perhaps eating is a private affair, or banquets and formal dinners are seen as the highest form of politeness."],
    ["65", "Travellers may bedistrusted or feted, or perhaps the culture frowns on those who leave their homes."],
    ["66", "Something strange is going on. The government is being subverted by another group or agency."]
